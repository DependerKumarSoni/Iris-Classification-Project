# Welcome to "Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning" Project.

## Introduction:

### Basic
Iris is a Flower which has 3 families -  namely - ***Setosa***, ***Virginica***, and ***VersiColor***.

This Repository Contains a Simple project on classification of Iris Flower Dataset. After completing this project, we'll have a machine learning model, able to classify the family of the flower by merely entering the length and breadth of its [sepal](https://biologydictionary.net/sepal/) and [petal](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/petal)

### Introduction to Dataset
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper **[The Use Of Multiple Measurements In Taxonomic Problems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)** as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

Now, here in this model, we'll predict the class of Iris flower based on its petal's and sepal's length and breadth.

**Note: This repository contains *Iris.names* file which can be used to understand data much clearly.**
      **This repository also contains *Iris.data* file which contains the actual dataset.**
      **Data Science concepts are already explained in *Iris_Classification_Project.ipynb* file available in this repository.**
      **We will use python 3 for this project. This project may be found in R but you need to search google for that..!**
